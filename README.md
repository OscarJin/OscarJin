## Hi, I'm @OscarJin ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‰ Major in Mechanical Engineering

ðŸ‘€ Current Research Topics:
- Computational Design and Simulation of Robots
  - I am actively learning about evolutionary algorithms of computational design and the basic knowledge of [Reinfrocement Learning](https://oscarjin.github.io/categories/rl/)
- FEM Analysis on construction erros of high-speed railway OCS
  - I built a simulation model for the high-speed railway OCS in Solidworks and ANSYS.
  - I proposed a novel solution that integrated cantilevers and wires to eliminate the errors on straighness of contact wires.

### Enjoy Coding
